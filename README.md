[Bug tracking](https://github.com/HackerNews/HN/issues) for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).

Please only report bugs. Feature requests belong [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=363). A good example is reporting something now broken that used to work, like [#2](https://github.com/HackerNews/HN/issues/2) and [#9](https://github.com/HackerNews/HN/issues/9).

If you have questions about your account specifically, please [email info@ycombinator.com](mailto:info@ycombinator.com).

I don't do any moderation, and won't say much about it, except to point out that most things you'll notice are automated.  If you think we messed up royally, please read the [guidelines](http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html) and then [email info@ycombinator.com](mailto:info@ycombinator.com).
