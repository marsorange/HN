[Bug tracking](https://github.com/HackerNews/HN/issues) for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).

Please only report bugs. Feature requests belong [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=363). A good example is reporting something now broken that used to work, like [#2](https://github.com/HackerNews/HN/issues/2) and [#9](https://github.com/HackerNews/HN/issues/9).
